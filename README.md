Developed a ticket management system utilizing an event-driven architecture (EDA) to enhance responsiveness and scalability. This system effectively manages ticketing processes by leveraging asynchronous communication and real-time event handling. Key features include an event-driven architecture that ensures efficient processing and management of ticket events, improving user experience and system performance, as well as containerization with Docker for easier deployment, scalability, and consistency across various environments. The project employs RabbitMQ for message queuing, Django for web application development, and PostgreSQL for robust data management.
